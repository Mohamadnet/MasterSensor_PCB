# MasterSensor_PCB
Master and Sensor PCB 

These are sample PCB for IoT project . In the Master side we tried to aggregate informations from sensors using CUBIE board
On the other hand, sensors are responsible for receiving Master command and perform some commands on field or monitor the system's
state and send it back to the Master
